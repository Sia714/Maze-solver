# Maze-solver

## Background
The Maze Solver project aims to create an interactive application that generates a maze and allows a user to solve it manually or automatically. The maze generation algorithm ensures a unique path from start to finish, and the player can navigate through the maze using mouse clicks. This project integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing interface.
## Objectives
•	Develop an algorithm to generate a maze.
•	Implement a user interface for maze generation and player movement.
•	Enable manual navigation through the maze using mouse clicks.
•	Implement an algorithm for automatic maze solving.
